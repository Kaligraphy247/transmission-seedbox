- To run gunicorn as a daemon, you need to create a service file in `/etc/systemd/system`

```

> **Note:** Replace all the text in *angled brackets < >* with your own information

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn server for <myseedboxname or NameOfYourChoice>

[Service]
User=<root or your username>
WorkingDirectory=<pathToYourSeedboxDirector>
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'cd <projectDirectory> && source <venvDir>/bin/activate && gunicorn wsgi:app'
Restart=always


[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
### Start service
- reload the service file to include the new service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

- start the service
```bash
sudo systemctl start <NameOfServiceYouJustCreated>.service
```

- check the status of your new service
```bash
sudo systemctl status <NameOfServiceYouJustCreated>.service
```

- to enable your service on every reboot
```bash
sudo systemctl enable <NameOfServiceYouJustCreated>.service
```

- to disable your service on every reboot
```bash
sudo systemctl disable <NameOfServiceYouJustCreated>.service
```
